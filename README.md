# MSP430 C Learning – Test Engineering with Embedded C

Welcome to my MSP430 learning project. This is part of my System Test Engineering journey where I combine embedded C programming with test design to build a real-world hardware testing portfolio.

## 🙋 About Me

I’m Adeyemi Mayowa, a Master's student in System Test Engineering. This repository documents my hands-on learning in embedded testing with MSP430 — combining real hardware, C programming, and test design to grow my skills in low-level software and validation.

## 🔍 Goal

To learn C programming through practical hardware tasks using the MSP430 LaunchPad and build the foundations of embedded test automation.

## 🧪 Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Blink LED1 (P1.0)
- Toggle red LED every 1 second
- Used basic GPIO output and delay loop

### ✅ Task 2: Blink LED1 and LED2 Twice Quickly
- Blinks both LEDs rapidly twice, followed by a delay
- Introduced `for` loop and custom delay function

### ✅ Task 3: Button Input to Control LED
- Read onboard button S2 (P1.3)
- Turn on LED1 (P1.0) when button is pressed
- Demonstrated input pull-up configuration
